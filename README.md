An example taken from the Meteor discussion group topic [Sending a string from the server to the client](https://forums.meteor.com/t/sending-a-string-from-the-server-to-the-client/398). The code is taken from two answers provided by [rahul](https://forums.meteor.com/users/rahul/activity).

The code illustrated some important Meteor concepts so I hooked it up to a UI to see how it worked.


Had to remove autopublish.
